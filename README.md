> By D.C. - I've changed colors, headers, and table formats. Everybody likes blue. Besides, I've also changed the symbols on the headers to provide a more formal look. Everything else is based on the fantastic work made by Kirigaya.

> Designed and tested on Windows11 & Ubuntu18.04. Not fully tested, but should work for MacOS.

Some bugs have been fixed. Thanks for [hongyun-robot](https://github.com/hongyun-robot) and [LILKOTYO](https://github.com/LILKOTYO)!

# Haru

## Introduction

`Haru` is a light style theme for Typora. I hope it can bring you inspiration, elegance and peaceful mind.

## Feature

### Round corner design

Almost every element or container in haru is designed as round corner, including `img`, `iframe`, word count labe and even some input widget embedded in Typora.

### Table without border

Table in haru doesn't have border and cell will be highlighted on any hover.

### Title + Blockquote?

I combine title and blockquote to make extra information:

```markdown
> # In Haru, you can use `>` + `#` to create Tips block

> ## `>` + `##` = warning block

> ### `>` + `###` = error block

> #### `>` + `####` = remind block
```

rendered result:

## Last but not least

- Actually, many ideas in `haru.css` are copied from my own website [汇尘轩](https://xn--lbun88i.studio/) directly, which contains an online markdown render.
- The open source html2pdf tools almost drive me mad :anger: , so I decide to go back to Typora and transfer the style I designed for my website to Typora, in order to enjoy the peace and inspiration which I have designed for myself :smile:
- Some ideas are inspired by typora themes listed below:
  - [see-yue](https://github.com/jinghu-moon/typora-see-yue-theme)
  - [mint](https://github.com/Y1chenYao/typora-mint-theme)
  - [autumnus](https://github.com/Soanguy/typora-theme-autumnus)


> Yeah, `mint` is an excellent theme; `see-yue` is quite inspirational; `autumnus` is peaceful, I quite like the style of its title.
